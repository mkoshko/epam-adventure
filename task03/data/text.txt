    The organization of a simple bus-oriented computer is shown in Fig. 2-1.
TheCPU(Central Processing Unit) is the ‘‘brain’’ of the computer. Its function
is to execute programs stored in the main memory by fetching their instructions,
examining them, and then executing them one after another. The components are
connected by a bus, which is a collection of parallel wires for transmitting
address,data, and control signals. Buses can be external to the CPU, connecting
it to memory and I/O devices, but also internal to the CPU, as we will see
shortly. Modern computers have multiple buses.
    The CPU is composed of several distinct parts. The control unit is responsible
for fetching instructions from main memory and determining their type.
The arithmetic logic unit performs operations such as addition and Boolean AND
needed to carry out the instructions.
    The CPU also contains a small, high-speed memory used to store temporary results
and certain control information. This memory is made up of a number of registers,
each having has a certain size and function. Usually, all the registers have the
same size. Each register can hold one number, up to some maximum determined by
its size. Registers can be read and written at high speed since they are internal
to the CPU.
    The most important register is theProgram Counter(PC), which points to the next
instruction to be fetched for execution. The name ‘‘program counter’’ is
somewhat misleading because it has nothing to do with counting anything, but the
term is universally used. Also important is theInstruction Register(IR), which
holds the instruction currently being executed. Most computers have numerous
other registers as well, some of them general purpose as well as some for specific
purposes. Yet other registers are used by the operating system to control the
computer.
